# Content-Based Recommendation Engine for articles

ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Content-Based Recommendation Engine!**  
This project demonstrates how to build a content-based recommendation engine that suggests articles using a combination of traditional machine learning and advanced NLP techniques.

## Key Features
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction.
- **Cosine Similarity** for measuring the relevance between articles.
- **BGE-M3 Transformer Models** for generating high-quality semantic embeddings.
- **Data Cleaning** to preprocess and filter out irrelevant or noisy data, optimizing model performance.
- **Gradio UI** for real-time interaction and easy exploration of article recommendations.

## Overview
This recommendation engine suggests articles based on the content of the articles themselves. It uses traditional methods like **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**, alongside more advanced **transformer-based models** (BGE-M3), to generate meaningful, personalized recommendations.

### How It Works:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Irrelevant or noisy data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure the quality of recommendations.
2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - **TF-IDF** is used to extract important terms and their significance within the article.
   - **BGE-M3 Transformer** models generate contextual embeddings of the article content.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: **Cosine Similarity** is applied to measure the relevance between articles, and recommendations are ranked based on this similarity score.
4. **Gradio UI**: Integrated a **Gradio** interface to allow users to input articles and receive recommendations instantly.
